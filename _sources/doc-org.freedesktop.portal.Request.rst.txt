.. _org.freedesktop.portal.Request Description:

Shared request interface

The Request interface is shared by all portal interfaces. When a
portal method is called, the reply includes a handle (i.e. object path)
for a Request object, which will stay alive for the duration of the
user interaction related to the method call.

The portal indicates that a portal request interaction is over by
emitting the `org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response`_ signal on the
Request object.

The application can abort the interaction calling
`org.freedesktop.portal.Request.Close`_ on the Request object.

Since version 0.9 of xdg-desktop-portal, the handle will be of the form
/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop/request/SENDER/TOKEN,
where SENDER is the callers unique name, with the initial ':' removed and
all '.' replaced by '_', and TOKEN is a unique token that the caller provided
with the handle_token key in the options vardict.

This change was made to let applications subscribe to the Response signal before
making the initial portal call, thereby avoiding a race condition. It is recommended
that the caller should verify that the returned handle is what it expected, and update
its signal subscription if it isn't. This ensures that applications will work with both
old and new versions of xdg-desktop-portal.

The token that the caller provides should be unique and not guessable. To avoid clashes
with calls made from unrelated libraries, it is a good idea to use a per-library prefix
combined with a random number.

    Response (
      response u,
      results a{sv}
    )



Emitted when the user interaction for a portal request is over.

<simplelist>
<member>0: Success, the request is carried out</member>
<member>1: The user cancelled the interaction</member>
<member>2: The user interaction was ended in some other way</member>
</simplelist>



response
  Numeric response

results
  Vardict with results. The keys and values in the vardict depend on the request.
