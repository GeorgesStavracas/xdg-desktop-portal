.. _org.freedesktop.portal.NetworkMonitor Description:

Network monitoring portal

The NetworkMonitor interface provides network status information
to sandboxed applications. It is not a portal in the strict sense,
since it does not involve user interaction. Applications are
expected to use this interface indirectly, via a library API
such as the GLib GNetworkMonitor interface.

This documentation describes version 3 of this interface.

Methods

.. org.freedesktop.portal.NetworkMonitor Methods:

org.freedesktop.portal.NetworkMonitor.GetAvailable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    GetAvailable (
      OUT available b
    )



Returns whether the network is considered available.
That is, whether the system as a default route for
at least one of IPv4 or IPv6.

This method was added in version 2 to replace
the available property.





org.freedesktop.portal.NetworkMonitor.GetMetered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    GetMetered (
      OUT metered b
    )



Returns whether the network is considered metered.
That is, whether the system as traffic flowing through
the default connection that is subject ot limitations
by service providers.

This method was added in version 2 to replace
the metered property.





org.freedesktop.portal.NetworkMonitor.GetConnectivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    GetConnectivity (
      OUT connectivity u
    )



Returns more detailed information about the host's network
connectivity. The meaning of the value is:
<simplelist>
<member>1: Local only. The host is not configured with a route to the internet.</member>
<member>2: Limited connectivity. The host is connected to a network, but can't reach the full internet.</member>
<member>3: Captive portal. The host is behind a captive portal and cannot reach the full internet.</member>
<member>4: Full network. The host connected to a network, and can reach the full internet.</member>
</simplelist>

This method was added in version 2 to replace
the connectivity property.





org.freedesktop.portal.NetworkMonitor.GetStatus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    GetStatus (
      OUT status a{sv}
    )



Returns the three values all at once.

The following results get returned via ``status``:
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>available b</term>
<listitem><para>
Whether the network is available.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>metered b</term>
<listitem><para>
Whether the network is metered.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>connectivity u</term>
<listitem><para>
The level of connectivity.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

This method was added in version 3 to avoid multiple round-trips.





org.freedesktop.portal.NetworkMonitor.CanReach
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    CanReach (
      IN hostname s,
      IN port u,
      OUT reachable b
    )



Returns whether the given hostname is believed to be reachable.
This method was added in version 3.



hostname
  the hostname to reach

port
  the port to reach
