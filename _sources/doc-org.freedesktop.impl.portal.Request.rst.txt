Shared request interface

The Request interface is shared by all portal backend interfaces.
When a backend method is called, the backend exports a Request object
on the object path that was sent with the method call. The Request
will stay alive for the duration of the user interaction related to
the method call.

The portal can abort the interaction calling
`org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Request.Close`_ on the Request object.
