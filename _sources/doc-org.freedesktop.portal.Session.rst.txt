.. _org.freedesktop.portal.Session Description:

Shared session interface

The Session interface is shared by all portal interfaces that involve
long lived sessions.  When a method that creates a session is called, if
successful, the reply will include a session handle (i.e. object path) for
a Session object, which will stay alive for the duration of the session.

The duration of the session is defined by the interface that creates it.
For convenience, the interface contains a method
`org.freedesktop.portal.Session.Close`_, and a signal
`org.freedesktop.portal.Session::Closed`_. Whether it is allowed to directly
call `org.freedesktop.portal.Session.Close`_ depends on the interface.

The handle of a session will be of the form
/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop/session/SENDER/TOKEN, where SENDER is the
callers unique name, with the initial ':' removed and all '.' replaced by
'_', and TOKEN is a unique token that the caller provided with the
session_handle_token key in the options vardict of the method creating
the session.

The token that the caller provides should be unique and not guessable. To
avoid clashes with calls made from unrelated libraries, it is a good idea
to use a per-library prefix combined with a random number.

A client who started a session vanishing from the D-Bus is equivalent to
closing all active sessions made by said client.
